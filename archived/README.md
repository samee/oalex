Things that I had been experimenting on, but have since stopped working on. It
is possible that at some point I'll delete them. But for now, I feel like I
look at the code often enough that it makes sense to keep them around in the
master branch.

For now, the tests in this folder are still being maintained.

There must be no dependencies from outside this folder into files in here.
