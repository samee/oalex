rule lexpr choices:
| ident -> (id ~ ident)
| "( [ elt elt ... ] )"
where:
  elt ~ lexpr
outputs: { id, elts: [elt, ...] }

rule ident: /[a-zA-Z_]+/

example lexpr:
  (a b (c d))
outputs: {
  elts: [
    { id: "a" },
    { id: "b" },
    { elts: [
      { id: "c" },
      { id: "d" }
    ]}
  ]
}

# Notes:
# * This is really a codegen test, but I don't have a good script to run
#   it automatically.
# * The output is always producing an empty list.
#   The struct type should be able to represent the difference between
#   "has empty list" vs. "has no list". Even the oalex syntax above should
#   be able to distinguish between them.
# * It was way too easy to accidentally produce JsonLike output when I
#   wanted a struct. E.g. when I split it up into two parts, so outermost
#   decl is never an id.
