rule lexpr choices:
| (id ~ /[a-zA-Z_]+/)
| "( [ elt elt ... ] )"
where:
  elt ~ lexpr
outputs: { id, elts: [elt, ...] }

# Notes:
# * This is really a codegen test, but I don't have a good script to run
#   it automatically.
# * The output is always producing an empty list.
#   The struct type should be able to represent the difference between
#   "has empty list" vs. "has no list". Even the oalex syntax above should
#   be able to distinguish between them.
# * It was way too easy to accidentally produce JsonLike output when I
#   wanted a struct. E.g. when I split it up into two parts, so outermost
#   decl is never an id.
