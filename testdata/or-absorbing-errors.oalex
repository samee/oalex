# What I need is a peekMatch that produces errors.
# We need to test if a success-returning but error-making peekMatch()
# is considered a successful peek or failed peek.

rule acceptTestWord: 'TestWord'
rule rejectTestWord: 'BadWord'

rule matchAfterAbsorb choices:
| rejectTestWord   # This will produce error messages on "TestWord"
| acceptTestWord   # But then we accept "TestWord" anyway.

# The question now is: if matchAfterAbsorb is used as a lookahead,
# is it considered a success or failure? It tests peekMatch().
rule peekTester choices:
| matchAfterAbsorb -> acceptTestWord
| error 'Failed to absorb errors'

example peekTester:
  TestWord
outputs success

rule orPattern:
  rejectTestWord | acceptTestWord
outputs: { acceptTestWord, rejectTestWord }

example orPattern:
