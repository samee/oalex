# This checks for a bug where codegen was raising a BugEx when
# mult-match rules with templates had a single-quoted string or regex
# as a right-hand side. The bug was that we were returning a string match,
# while templates insist on a struct return value.

rule decl_keyword choices:
| "decl" -> 'decl'
| 'var'
outputs: { keyword: 'decl' }
