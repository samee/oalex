rule ident: /[a-z]+/

# We used to not support a single identifier on the rhs
# of a rule ident that used an outputs template.
# This "double-quoting" was a workaround at the time.
# This workaround is now unnecessary, but we still have tests
# to check that this case is supported.
rule wrapped_ident: "ident"
outputs: {
  varname: ident
}

example wrapped_ident:
  foo
outputs: {
  varname: "foo"
}
